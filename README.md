Machine learning  is  a  set  of  methods  which  enables  the  computer  to  take  decisions  or infer conclusions without  us guiding  it. Machine  learning  focuses  on the development  of  computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automaticallywithout human intervention or assistance  and adjust  actions  accordingly. For  Example,it  is  just  like  how  babies  learn  to  walk. Every time they fall, they learn from their mistakes (i.e., not to stand like that again).

Similarly, machines also work & develop intuition from their environment. It is not something of the far-off future. It is here today, and it is shaping and simplifying the way we live, work, travel and communicate
## Types ofMachine LearningTypes ofMachine Learning
- These three methods correspond to three branches of Machine learning:
### Supervised Learning:
- In this type of learning, the machine learns under the supervision of training  labels.  It  functions  by  mapping  the  input  data  to  the  output  data based  on  the provided training data.
### Unsupervised Learning 
- In this type of learning, the machine learns without the supervision of training labels.
### Reinforcement  Learning
- In  this  type  of  learning,  an  agent  learns  in  an  interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its actions and experiences.

#### Following are the Data sets where few Techniques have been implemented 
- Firstly a basic statistical method has been done on IRIS data set. 
##### IRIS data set is basically classification problem.
- Logistic regression is the method used to classify the flowers
